This works fine, but is "hard to use" in two aspects.  First,
    although this idiom is known to veteran Pythoneers, it is not at
    all obvious to newbies -- either in terms of its algorithm
    (inverting the ordering of item tuples) or its implementation
    (using list comprehensions -- which are an advanced Python
    feature.)  Second, it requires having to repeatedly type a lot of
    "grunge", resulting in both tedium and mistakes.

    We therefore would rather Python provide a method of sorting
    dictionaries by value which would be both easy for newbies to
    understand (or, better yet, not to _have to_ understand) and
    easier for all to use.
